Presentation of the security principles in WAPT
===============================================

Preamble and definitions
------------------------

.. attention::

  The WAPT service operates as a **privileged** system account.

.. attention::

  From WAPT version 1.5, the default installation directory becomes
  :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt`.

.. hint::

  the sub-components :program:`wapttray`, :program:`waptservice` and
  :program:`waptexit` of the WAPT agent may be optionally deactivated
  according to usage context.

Perimeter to secure
+++++++++++++++++++

The elements to secure and that strictly concern WAPT are:

* **the WAPT Server** (*waptserver*);

* **the WAPT agents** (*wapt-get*) and its sub-components
  (*wapttray*, *waptservice* et *waptexit*);

* **the management console** (*waptconsole*) ;

* **the network communications** between these different components;

In complement to the elements listed above, an :term:`Organization`
that uses WAPT will have to choose and follow a methodology that is adapted
to her use case:

* insure the safe provisioning of all other files that are to be incorporated
  into a WAPT package;

* develop the WAPT package python installation script so as to avoid
  any exploitable security or confidentiality defect;

* manage in a safe way the private keys for signing the packages;

* manage in a safe way the Autorities of Certification and Revocation
  for the SSL and HTTPS certificates;

The safe management of these complementary elements is excluded
from the perimeter of this documentation.

Description of typical users
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following roles must be understood to evaluate the security principles
incorporated in WAPT:

* **User**

  individual/ user of a WAPT equipped end-device (**Enterprise**
  and **Community**);

* **Package Deployer**

  individual with the ability to sign packages that **DO NOT** contain python
  code (generally *group*, *host* and *unit* packages) and to upload
  the package to the main repository (**Enterprise**);

* **Package Developer**

  individual with the ability to sign any package, may it include or not include
  python code, and to upload the package to the main repository
  (**Enterprise**);

* **SuperAdmin**

  all priviledged account in WAPT (**Community**);

* **Local Administrator**

  individual with local administration right of the WAPT equipped
  end-devices (**Enterprise** and **Community**);

.. note::

  Depending on the context within this documentation, an :term:`Administrator`
  will have the meaning of a :term:`Package Deployer`,
  :term:`Package Developer` or :term:`SuperAdmin`.

.. note::

  The :term:`Users` that are members of the Active Directory security group
  **waptselfservice** are considered to be :term:`Local Administrators`
  from the point of view of WAPT security.

Description of the sensitive assets in WAPT
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By definition, a sensitive asset is a data (or a function) that is considered
as having value to an attacker.

Its value is estimated according to several security criteria
(also called security needs):

* availability;

* integrity;

* confidentiality;

* authenticity;

The sensitive assets to protect are as follows:

Sensitive assets A1: communications
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Communications between the central WAPT Server and the WAPT agents, as well
as the communications between the WAPT console and the WAPT Server
are a sensitive asset and they must be protected.

.. note::

  Need for securing the communications

  * integrity;

  * confidentiality;

  * authenticity;

Sensitive asset A2: inventory data
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The informations on the state of deployment of the packages, as well
as hardware and software configurations of the end-devices
are a sensitive asset and they must be protected.

.. note::

  Security need of the inventory data

  * integrity;

  * confidentiality;

Sensitive asset A3: log journals
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The logs generated by WAPT on the central server and by the agents
are a sensitive asset and they must be protected.

.. note::

  Security needs of historical logs

  * availability;

Sensitive asset A4: configuration values
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The configuration values (HTTPS server keys, database access configuration,
server authentication configuration) are sensitive and they must be protected.

.. note::

  Security needs of configuration values

  * integrity;

  * confidentiality;

Sensitive asset A5: WAPT executables on the end-devices
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The WAPT executables installed on managed clients are a sensitive asset
and they must be protected (i.e. the content of the :file:`<WAPT>` directory
that includes the binaries, the configuration files and the local database).

.. note::

  Security needs of configuration values

  * integrity;

Sensitive asset A6: authentication
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Authentication to the administration console as well as the authentication
of the clients on the WAPT Server are a sensitive asset
and they must be protected (public key of each WAPT agent).

.. note::

  Security need of the authentication

  * integrity;

  * confidentiality;

Description of hypotheses on WAPT's working environment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By definition, the hypotheses are statements on WAPT's usage context
or its working environment.

The following hypotheses on WAPT's working environment must be considered:

Hypothesis H1: the Administrators and the Package Deployers are trained
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :term:`Administrators` and the :term:`Package Deployers` are trained
on WAPT usage. In particular, they must insure that their logins,
passwords and private keys are kept secret.

Hypothesis H2: the operating systems underlying WAPT are sane
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

WAPT's underlying operating systems implement adequate protection mechanisms
that are configured according to good practice (confinement, access control,
etc).

The underlying operating system are patched and up to date at the time
of the installation of WAPT, they are free of viruses, trojan horses, etc.

Hypothesis H3: the binaries necessary for WAPT to operate are sane
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

All libraries and tools necessary to install WAPT are considered to be sane.
Upon the WAPT agent receiving a request, the agent verifies that the request
has been properly signed.

Hypothesis H4: the WAPT packages are built in a safe manner
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :term:`Administrator` is responsible for insuring that the files
to be incorporated into a WAPT package come from safe sources
and are free of viruses, trojan horses, etc.

Hypothesis H5: the Users of the end-devices are not Local Administrators
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A :term:`User` must not have local administration rights on the WAPT equipped
device. Otherwise, the :term:`User` must be considered a
:term:`Local Administrator`.

In particular, a :term:`User` must not have write access
to WAPT's installation directory.

Hypothesis H6: the Local Administrators are trained
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The :term:`Local Administrator` of a device must be trained to use WAPT,
or at minimum he must not make changes to files located in WAPT's
installation folder.

Description of threats on WAPT's sensitive assets
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By definition, a threat is an action or an event susceptible to bring prejudice
to the security of the WAPT equipped device.

The threat agents to be considered for evaluating security in WAPT
are as follows:

* **Unauthorized entities**: it is a human attacker or en entity that interacts
  with WAPT without legitimately having access to it.

.. note::

  The :term:`Administrators` and the :term:`Local Administrators`
  are not considered to be attackers.

The threats bearing on WAPT's sensitive assets defined above are as follow:

Threat T1: installation of an unsafe software by an unauthorized entity
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This threat corresponds to an attacker that would be able to use a component
of the WAPT agent to permanently install a malicious application, or to remove
or deactivate a security component on the WAPT equipped device.

Threat T2: modification of configuration values by an unauthorized entity
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The threat corresponds to an attacker that would be able to modify
a configuration element of WAPT that had been previously defined
by a legitimate WAPT :term:`Administrator`.

Threat T3: illegitimate access by an unauthorized entity
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This threat corresponds to an attacker that would be able to recover
the login credentials of an :term:`Administrator`, or bypass the authentication
mechanism in such a way to access or alter a sensitive asset stored
on the server. It also corresponds to an attacker being able to impersonate
a WAPT agent.

Threat T4: network listening by an unauthorized entity
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This threat corresponds to an attacker being able to intercept
and gain knowledge of network traffic between the WAPT agents
and the server hosting WAPT.

Threat T5: modification of network traffic by an unauthorized entity (type *Man In The Middle*)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

This threat corresponds to an attacker being able to alter network traffic
between the agents and the server hosting WAPT,
or between the console and the WAPT Server.

Description of WAPT's security functions
----------------------------------------

By definition, security functions are the set of technical measures
and mechanisms implemented to protect in a proportionate way the sensitive
assets against identified threats.

Security function F1: access authentication
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _initial_machine_registration:

Security function F1A: authentication of a device on initial registration in the WAPT database
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * the registering of an illegitimate device in the database;

  * a denial-of-service attack by overloading the database;

  * the insertion of a fraudulent inventory in the database;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To exist in the database and thus to appear in the management console,
a device must register with the WAPT Server using the :command:`register`
command.

The :command:`register` command may be executed automatically when installing
or updating the WAPT agent if the device has a Kerberos machine account
that is correctly registered in the :term:`Organization`'s Active Directory
domain.

If the device does not present to the WAPT Server a valid Kerberos
ticket, then the :command:`register` fails;

.. note::

  The Kerberos registration method assumes that the Active Directory server
  is responsive at the time of launch of the :command:`register` command.

.. _HTTPS_certificate_verification:

Security function F1B: verification of server HTTPS certificates by the WAPT agents
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. note::

  risks avoided (notably MITM)

  * the sending of sensitive informations to an illegitimate
    and unauthorized WAPT Server;

  * the recovery of sensitive informations by an unauthorized entity;

  * the display of fake information in the management console of the
    :term:`Administrator`;

  * an incorrect date to be sent upon a HEAD request, thus preventing future
    upgrades (request for a modified file date);

  * sending the WAPT console password to an illegitimate
    and unauthorized WAPT Server;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the secured version of WAPT to work correctly:

* an option for verifying the server HTTPS certificate is introduced
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\wapt-get.ini` on the WAPT agents
  that will **force the verification of the server certificate
  by the WAPT agents**;

* an option for verifying the server HTTPS certificate is introduced
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\wapt-get.ini` on the WAPT agents
  that will force the verification of the server certificate
  by the **WAPT console**;

Technically, it may be implemented in two ways:

* by using a certificate verification tool implemented in the configuration file
  of WAPT's :program:`Nginx` web server; this method is typically provided
  by a :term:`Certificate Authority` that is trusted by your network;

* by using the *certificate pinning* method, which consists of providing
  the WAPT agent a short list of trusted certificates that will be stored
  in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\ssl\\server`;


Security function F1C: no listening port on the WAPT agents
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * an unauthorized entity using an open port fraudulently;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The connections to the WAPT Server are initiated exclusively by the agents,
and the forced immediate actions are relayed through a permanent websocket
initiated by the WAPT agent (:command:`update`/ :command:`upgrade`/
:command:`install` ...).

.. note::

  if HTTPS is activated, then the WAPT agent checks that the websocket
  is connecting to the rightful server.

.. _signing_inventory_updates:

Security function F1D: signature of inventory return states
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.3.12.13

.. note::

  risks avoided

   * an unauthorized entity sending a fake inventory for a device
     that rightfully exists in the database;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* On the first :command:`register`, each device generates a key/ certificate
  pair that is stored in :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\private`, only
  accessible in read-only mode to :term:`Local Administrators`. Once the device
  has successfully registered, the public key is sent to the WAPT Server;

* When the inventory is updated, the new inventory status is sent along with
  the private key of the device. The new inventory is then decrypted
  with the public key stored in the database;

* The server will refuse any inventory that is signed with a wrong key;

Security function F1E: verification of authorizations before launching of WAPT commands
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * avoid the execution of sensitive tasks on WAPT clients
    by unauthorized entities;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :term:`Users` interact with WAPT through WAPT user interfaces
(:program:`wapt-get` in command line interface, :program:`wapttray`,
:program:`waptexit`, :program:`waptselfservice`).

The user interfaces then delegate the execution of the desired tasks
to the local WAPT service running as system account.

The following actions do not require to be authenticated with the WAPT service:

* :code:`wapt-get update` (update the available list of packages);

* :code:`wapt-get upgrade` (launch waiting upgrades);

* :code:`wapt-get download-upgrade` (download waiting upgrades);

* :code:`wapt-get clean` (remove packages left in cache after installation);

* stop any running WAPT task;

* stop/ reload the WAPT service;

The other actions require the :term:`User` be authenticated and the :term:`User`
either be a member of the **waptselfservice** Active Directory security group,
or be a :term:`Local Administrator`, they are:

* :code:`wapt-get install`: requests the WAPT agent to install a WAPT package
  flagged as **MISSING**;

* :code:`wapt-get remove`: requests the WAPT agent to remove a package;

* :code:`wapt-get forget`: requests the WAPT agent to forget the existence
  of a previously installed WAPT package without removing the software
  or the configuration;

.. _WAPT_package_installation_process_integrity:

Security function F2: protecting the integrity of the installation process of WAPT packages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Security function F2A: signature of WAPT packages
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * to avoid an unauthorized entity modifying the content or the behavior
    of a WAPT package;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* when an :term:`Administrator` or a :term:`Package Deployer` builds
  a WAPT package, the file :file:`manifest.sha256` is created that lists
  the control sums of all files in the package;

* a file :file:`signature.sha256` **encrypted** with the WAPT agent's
  private key is then created in the folder :file:`<WAPT>`; it contains
  the control sum of the file :file:`manifest.sha256`;

* the whole is then compressed and suffixed with a *.wapt* extension;

* when a WAPT agent downloads a WAPT package, the agent checks that the file
  :file:`signature.sha256` has been signed with the private key that matches
  the certificate present in the folder :file:`certificate.crt`;

* the WAPT agent then checks that the certificate or the chain of certificates
  in :file:`certificate.crt` has been signed with a key matching
  one of the certificates present in the folder
  :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\ssl`;

* the WAPT agent then generates the control sum of all the files contained
  in the package (except the files :file:`signature.sha256`
  and :file:`certificate.crt `) and verifies that it matches the file
  :file:`manifest.sha256` contained in the package;

* if one of these steps does not pass, this means that a file has been modified/
  added/ removed. The execution of the :file:`setup.py` is then canceled.

* the altered package is then deleted from the local cache and the event
  is journalized in the logs of the agent;

.. note::

  Since the version 1.5 of WAPT, the format of the :file:`manifest` file
  has changed from *sha1* to *sha256*.

Security function F2B: signature of the attributes in the control files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.4

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * an unauthorized entity modifying WAPT dependencies on WAPT equipped devices
    by falsifying :file:`https://waptserver/wapt/Packages`;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a WAPT package is signed, the sensitive attributes of the package
are listed inside the **signed_attributes** attribute of the control file.

.. note::

   Example of a *signed_attributes* list:

   *package*, *version*, *architecture*, *section*, *priority*, *maintainer*,
   *description*, *depends*, *conflicts*, *maturity*, *locale*,
   *min_os_version*, *max_os_version*, *min_wapt_version*, *sources*,
   *installed_size*, *signer*, *signer_fingerprint*, *signature_date*,
   *signed_attributes*,

The attributes listed in *signed_attributes* are signed with the private key
of the :term:`Administrator` and stored in the attribute *signature*
of the :file:`control` file.

The certificate matching the private key is stored
in :file:`<WAPT>\\certificate.crt` inside the WAPT package.

On the WAPT Server, the index :file:`Packages` is regenerated
when the :command:`wapt-scanpackages` command is triggered by adding
or removing a package.

The WAPT Server extracts from each package the certificate of the signer
and adds it in the :file:`Packages` zip file in the directory :file:`ssl`.
Each certificate is named after its hexadecimal encoded fingerprint.

When the WAPT agent launches an :command:`update`, it downloads
the :file:`Packages` index file that contains the signed attributes
of all available packages and the certificates of the signers.

If the signer's certificate is approved, which means that the certificate
has been signed by a Trusted :term:`Certificate Authority` or that the
certificate itself is trusted, AND if the signer's certificate can verify
the attributes' signature, the package is added to the index
of available packages. Otherwise it is ignored.

Security function F2C: access restriction to the installation folder of the WAPT agent
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * an unauthorized entity modifying the behavior of a WAPT agent;

The installation folder :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt` is accessible in
read-write mode:

* to the :term:`Local Administrators` by direct access to the installation
  folder of the WAPT agent on the device;

* to the :term:`Administrators` through the deployment of WAPT agent upgrades;

Neither the :term:`Package Deployers`, nor the :term:`Users` have write-access
to the WAPT agent's installation folder.

Security function F2D: total access restriction to the folder storing the key / certificate for inventory signing
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * an unauthorized entity falsifying an inventory status update;

  * an unauthorized entity impersonating the identity of a WAPT equipped device;

No access right is granted to any :term:`user`
to :file:`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\wapt\\private`, whomever he may be.
Only the WAPT agent has a write and read access to this folder.

.. note::

  This method for storing the key and the certificate results from a technical
  design choice that says that the WAPT equipped device would embed any and all
  information related to itself.

Security function F3: securing the communications between the different components of WAPT
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _signing_actions_relayed_to_WAPT_agents:

Security function F3A: signature of immediate action calls sent to the WAPT agents
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. note::

  risks avoided

  * an unauthorized entity sending falsified requests to the WAPT agents;

Solution implemented
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following commands are signed by the WAPT Server before being relayed
to the targeted WAPT agents via their Websockets:

* :code:`wapt-get install`: requests the WAPT agent to install a WAPT
  package flagged as **MISSING**;

* :code:`wapt-get remove`: requests the WAPT agent to remove a package;

* :code:`wapt-get forget`: requests the WAPT agent to forget the existence
  of a previously installed WAPT package without removing the software
  or the configuration;

* :code:`wapt-get update-status`: requests the WAPT agent to send
  its current inventory status to the WAPT Server;

* :code:`wapt-get upgrade`: requests the WAPT agent to execute
  a package flagged as **NEED UPGRADE**

* :code:`wapt-get update`: requests the WAPT agent to update
  the list of available packages;

All the attributes in the requests for immediate action are signed:

* the device's :term:`UUID`;

* the action (ex: :command:`install`);

* the arguments (ex: tis-firefox);

* the timestamp of the requests;

The certificate matching the signature is passed along:

* upon receiving a request, the WAPT agent verifies that the request
  has been properly signed;

* the agent will the verify that the timestamp is within
  a one minute delay window;

* ultimately, the agent will verify that the certificate is authorized
  to launch actions;
